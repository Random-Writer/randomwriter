Random Writer is an automatic music composition software tool that automatically generates and composes any kind of music based upon the user's preferences and tastes. 

Our first move is to release a software tool that generates a list of music for movie productions and TV shows. The user just need to easily set the duration time (like 3:35), musical style (like Jazz, Ragtime, Disco, etc. ) and emotion (sad, happy, dark, light, horror, etc. ), and hit the "start" button. Then the tool will generates a list of music that fits the users' needs, and users can quickly choose one of their favorite piece and insert it into a video as a fitted background music. 

Implementation and Realization: 
1. An SQL Database; 
2. An organized audio library; 
3. A chunk of code that combines mutilple audio files from the organized audio library. The files got combined together should be from the same sub-directory inside the audio library (i.e. have the same duration time and rhythm).
